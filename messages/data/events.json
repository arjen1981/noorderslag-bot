Weval appeared at Eurosonic last year, but this time around they will play live at both Eurosonic and Noorderslag.","img":"https://static.eurosonic-noorderslag.nl/fileadmin/_processed_/csm_408564-6d6330d7a7e47dc3fc8e014d39803018-original_da54136620.jpg","similar":[{"imgContent":"https://static.eurosonic-noorderslag.nl/fileadmin/_processed_/csm_440171-7ac1c5fcb93d2fdd249b5efb317dceab-original_5e53fedf13.jpg","artistName":"Flavien Berger","eventURL":"https://www.eurosonic-noorderslag.nl/en/festival/line-up/act/flavien-berger/"},{"imgContent":"https://static.eurosonic-noorderslag.nl/fileadmin/_processed_/csm_451442-eb149dadefb7dabcc0be5278e4e23194-original_8b902c1d89.jpg","artistName":"Gidge ","eventURL":"https://www.eurosonic-noorderslag.nl/en/festival/line-up/act/gidge/"},{"imgContent":"https://static.eurosonic-noorderslag.nl/fileadmin/_processed_/csm_462560-74f15f56f095f07514a6753674076042-original_1039895ca7.jpg","artistName":"goldFFinch","eventURL":"https://www.eurosonic-noorderslag.nl/en/festival/line-up/act/goldffinch/"},{"imgContent":"https://static.eurosonic-noorderslag.nl/fileadmin/_processed_/csm_447422-b187792950b639ae0ce702f918aa5d68-original_3a45b68f5b.jpg","artistName":"Guillaume Perret","eventURL":"https://www.eurosonic-noorderslag.nl/en/festival/line-up/act/guillaume-perret/"}]},{"id":"135416000461532","link":"/en/festival/line-up/act/brass-rave-unit/","description":"Brass Rave Unit","start":1484435700,"end":1484437500,"start_time":"00:15","end_time":"00:45","image":"https://www.eurosonic-noorderslag.nl/en/show-image/resource/11763/70c/70c/461532-429b7f74cc7c150c7e0b21a4f1223512-original.jpg/","day":"Saturday","location":"De Oosterpoort, Benedenzaal 1 - Kelder","text":"Brass Rave Unit delivers high octane muscle and lung powered raves at any location and at any time.

Weval appeared at Eurosonic last year, but this time around they will play live at both Eurosonic and Noorderslag.","img":"https://static.eurosonic-noorderslag.nl/fileadmin/_processed_/csm_408564-6d6330d7a7e47dc3fc8e014d39803018-original_da54136620.jpg","similar":[{"imgContent":"https://static.eurosonic-noorderslag.nl/fileadmin/_processed_/csm_440171-7ac1c5fcb93d2fdd249b5efb317dceab-original_5e53fedf13.jpg","artistName":"Flavien Berger","eventURL":"https://www.eurosonic-noorderslag.nl/en/festival/line-up/act/flavien-berger/"},{"imgContent":"https://static.eurosonic-noorderslag.nl/fileadmin/_processed_/csm_451442-eb149dadefb7dabcc0be5278e4e23194-original_8b902c1d89.jpg","artistName":"Gidge ","eventURL":"https://www.eurosonic-noorderslag.nl/en/festival/line-up/act/gidge/"},{"imgContent":"https://static.eurosonic-noorderslag.nl/fileadmin/_processed_/csm_462560-74f15f56f095f07514a6753674076042-original_1039895ca7.jpg","artistName":"goldFFinch","eventURL":"https://www.eurosonic-noorderslag.nl/en/festival/line-up/act/goldffinch/"},{"imgContent":"https://static.eurosonic-noorderslag.nl/fileadmin/_processed_/csm_447422-b187792950b639ae0ce702f918aa5d68-original_3a45b68f5b.jpg","artistName":"Guillaume Perret","eventURL":"https://www.eurosonic-noorderslag.nl/en/festival/line-up/act/guillaume-perret/"}]},{"id":"135246000463399","link":"/en/festival/line-up/act/noisia-outer-edges/","description":"Noisia ‘Outer Edges'","start":1484441400,"end":1484445000,"start_time":"01:50","end_time":"02:50","image":"https://www.eurosonic-noorderslag.nl/en/show-image/resource/12495/70c/70c/463399-17540034f97bcf7b47f5ab78b0bb1158-original.jpg/","day":"Saturday","location":"De Oosterpoort, Kleine Zaal","text":"Outer Edges is not just any album of Groningen drum &apos;n bass masters Noisia. &quot;It&apos;s called Outer Edges because it&apos;s us exploring the outer edges of what Noisia, the three of us together, is.

Now the singer from Porto has our own really tight band, allowing her to reveal her talent and her love for old-school soul and funk.","img":"https://static.eurosonic-noorderslag.nl/fileadmin/_processed_/csm_446826-3ccf5942ebfba8ea52e9850f41eb2392-original_3c506eca4a.jpg","similar":[{"imgContent":"https://static.eurosonic-noorderslag.nl/fileadmin/_processed_/csm_452778-759125431bd2d0b2bcefcd28f7bc537c-original_e009e87d90.jpg","artistName":"Amber Arcades","eventURL":"https://www.eurosonic-noorderslag.nl/en/festival/line-up/act/amber-arcades/"},{"imgContent":"https://static.eurosonic-noorderslag.nl/fileadmin/_processed_/csm_453127-a8e39a33bf67de8b7b88457de5b86f1c-original_254515cb9a.jpg","artistName":"ALTREGO","eventURL":"https://www.eurosonic-noorderslag.nl/en/festival/line-up/act/altrego/"},{"imgContent":"https://static.eurosonic-noorderslag.nl/fileadmin/_processed_/csm_453081-a6580bbb963d9656a5be6500a7fe2d0e-original_2cb281122c.jpg","artistName":"Aries","eventURL":"https://www.eurosonic-noorderslag.nl/en/festival/line-up/act/aries/"},{"imgContent":"https://static.eurosonic-noorderslag.nl/fileadmin/_processed_/csm_452609-dd4395c14f8bbac0dac2bdf54fc1ea9d-original_3c837ba885.jpg","artistName":"Barbagallo","eventURL":"https://www.eurosonic-noorderslag.nl/en/festival/line-up/act/barbagallo/"}]},{"id":"133468000453127","link":"/en/festival/line-up/act/altrego/","description":"ALTREGO","start":1484247600,"end":1484250300,"start_time":"20:00","end_time":"20:45","image":"https://www.eurosonic-noorderslag.nl/en/show-image/resource/13386/70c/70c/453127-a8e39a33bf67de8b7b88457de5b86f1c-original.jpg/","day":"Thursday","location":"Huize Maas, front","text":"London raised artist/songwriter/producer was advised by Adele to attend the prestigious BRIT school in London (which Amy Winehouse attended as well).

Their first single &apos;Sound &amp; Fury&apos; is a good tastemaker of things to come for this Groningen based indie-pop band.","img":"https://static.eurosonic-noorderslag.nl/fileadmin/_processed_/csm_463019-e52070f1470acad4d34652a01e7d7f98-original_d2aeaba03e.jpg","similar":[{"imgContent":"https://static.eurosonic-noorderslag.nl/fileadmin/_processed_/csm_450912-f85be460f503cd14a177c22eac990c28-original_ff95ea2046.jpg","artistName":"Swedish Death Candy","eventURL":"https://www.eurosonic-noorderslag.nl/en/festival/line-up/act/swedish-death-candy/"},{"imgContent":"https://static.eurosonic-noorderslag.nl/fileadmin/_processed_/csm_450341-5d84ecc0af46bf6f1108e7749c82c684-original_bbce402e32.jpg","artistName":"The Amazons","eventURL":"https://www.eurosonic-noorderslag.nl/en/festival/line-up/act/the-amazons/"},{"imgContent":"https://static.eurosonic-noorderslag.nl/fileadmin/_processed_/csm_445103-136dfe492d29bd92012d761c79612a55-original_ecb914ea1d.jpg","artistName":"The Ills","eventURL":"https://www.eurosonic-noorderslag.nl/en/festival/line-up/act/the-ills/"},{"imgContent":"https://static.eurosonic-noorderslag.nl/fileadmin/_processed_/csm_448444-e80cbf55c787847e8595b08c6eb8507f-original_e777d30e1c.jpg","artistName":"The Mysterons","eventURL":"https://www.eurosonic-noorderslag.nl/en/festival/line-up/act/the-mysterons/"}]},{"id":"133483000451748","link":"/en/festival/line-up/act/fleddy-melculy/","description":"Fleddy Melculy","start":1484350200,"end":1484352900,"start_time":"00:30","end_time":"01:15","image":"https://www.eurosonic-noorderslag.nl/en/show-image/resource/11904/70c/70c/451748-531beaa6d94bba47eb6addfe98ccac48-original.jpg/","day":"Friday","location":"Huize Maas, front","text":"After first single T-Shirt van Metallica (about kids wearing band shirts without knowing the music) many people thought Fleddy Melculy was a prank.

Now the singer from Porto has our own really tight band, allowing her to reveal her talent and her love for old-school soul and funk.","img":"https://static.eurosonic-noorderslag.nl/fileadmin/_processed_/csm_446826-3ccf5942ebfba8ea52e9850f41eb2392-original_3c506eca4a.jpg","similar":[{"imgContent":"https://static.eurosonic-noorderslag.nl/fileadmin/_processed_/csm_452778-759125431bd2d0b2bcefcd28f7bc537c-original_e009e87d90.jpg","artistName":"Amber Arcades","eventURL":"https://www.eurosonic-noorderslag.nl/en/festival/line-up/act/amber-arcades/"},{"imgContent":"https://static.eurosonic-noorderslag.nl/fileadmin/_processed_/csm_453127-a8e39a33bf67de8b7b88457de5b86f1c-original_254515cb9a.jpg","artistName":"ALTREGO","eventURL":"https://www.eurosonic-noorderslag.nl/en/festival/line-up/act/altrego/"},{"imgContent":"https://static.eurosonic-noorderslag.nl/fileadmin/_processed_/csm_453081-a6580bbb963d9656a5be6500a7fe2d0e-original_2cb281122c.jpg","artistName":"Aries","eventURL":"https://www.eurosonic-noorderslag.nl/en/festival/line-up/act/aries/"},{"imgContent":"https://static.eurosonic-noorderslag.nl/fileadmin/_processed_/csm_452609-dd4395c14f8bbac0dac2bdf54fc1ea9d-original_3c837ba885.jpg","artistName":"Barbagallo","eventURL":"https://www.eurosonic-noorderslag.nl/en/festival/line-up/act/barbagallo/"}]},{"id":"133502000465509","link":"/en/festival/line-up/act/lion-kojo/","description":"Lion Kojo","start":1484261100,"end":1484262000,"start_time":"23:45","end_time":"00:00","image":"https://www.eurosonic-noorderslag.nl/en/show-image/resource/12667/70c/70c/465509-4717b510462cbfa26878748463694686-original.JPG/","day":"Thursday","location":"Paradigm","text":"Lion Kojo is one of the up-and-coming names of Amsterdam.

Weval appeared at Eurosonic last year, but this time around they will play live at both Eurosonic and Noorderslag.","img":"https://static.eurosonic-noorderslag.nl/fileadmin/_processed_/csm_408564-6d6330d7a7e47dc3fc8e014d39803018-original_da54136620.jpg","similar":[{"imgContent":"https://static.eurosonic-noorderslag.nl/fileadmin/_processed_/csm_440171-7ac1c5fcb93d2fdd249b5efb317dceab-original_5e53fedf13.jpg","artistName":"Flavien Berger","eventURL":"https://www.eurosonic-noorderslag.nl/en/festival/line-up/act/flavien-berger/"},{"imgContent":"https://static.eurosonic-noorderslag.nl/fileadmin/_processed_/csm_451442-eb149dadefb7dabcc0be5278e4e23194-original_8b902c1d89.jpg","artistName":"Gidge ","eventURL":"https://www.eurosonic-noorderslag.nl/en/festival/line-up/act/gidge/"},{"imgContent":"https://static.eurosonic-noorderslag.nl/fileadmin/_processed_/csm_462560-74f15f56f095f07514a6753674076042-original_1039895ca7.jpg","artistName":"goldFFinch","eventURL":"https://www.eurosonic-noorderslag.nl/en/festival/line-up/act/goldffinch/"},{"imgContent":"https://static.eurosonic-noorderslag.nl/fileadmin/_processed_/csm_447422-b187792950b639ae0ce702f918aa5d68-original_3a45b68f5b.jpg","artistName":"Guillaume Perret","eventURL":"https://www.eurosonic-noorderslag.nl/en/festival/line-up/act/guillaume-perret/"}]},{"id":"133510000445551","link":"/en/festival/line-up/act/anna-of-the-north/","description":"Anna Of The North","start":1484336700,"end":1484339400,"start_time":"20:45","end_time":"21:30","image":"https://www.eurosonic-noorderslag.nl/en/show-image/resource/11601/70c/70c/445551-83855eefc788eb58fa7289d6a5e17495-original.jpg/","day":"Friday","location":"Simplon, main","text":"One of the bright new stars of the fresh wave of soulful electronic pop, Anna Of The North is from Oslo, Norway.
