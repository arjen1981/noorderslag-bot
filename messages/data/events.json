Weval appeared at Eurosonic last year, but this time around they will play live at both Eurosonic and Noorderslag.","img":"https://static.eurosonic-noorderslag.nl/fileadmin/_processed_/csm_408564-6d6330d7a7e47dc3fc8e014d39803018-original_da54136620.jpg","similar":[{"imgContent":"https://static.eurosonic-noorderslag.nl/fileadmin/_processed_/csm_440171-7ac1c5fcb93d2fdd249b5efb317dceab-original_5e53fedf13.jpg","artistName":"Flavien Berger","eventURL":"https://www.eurosonic-noorderslag.nl/en/festival/line-up/act/flavien-berger/"},{"imgContent":"https://static.eurosonic-noorderslag.nl/fileadmin/_processed_/csm_451442-eb149dadefb7dabcc0be5278e4e23194-original_8b902c1d89.jpg","artistName":"Gidge ","eventURL":"https://www.eurosonic-noorderslag.nl/en/festival/line-up/act/gidge/"},{"imgContent":"https://static.eurosonic-noorderslag.nl/fileadmin/_processed_/csm_462560-74f15f56f095f07514a6753674076042-original_1039895ca7.jpg","artistName":"goldFFinch","eventURL":"https://www.eurosonic-noorderslag.nl/en/festival/line-up/act/goldffinch/"},{"imgContent":"https://static.eurosonic-noorderslag.nl/fileadmin/_processed_/csm_447422-b187792950b639ae0ce702f918aa5d68-original_3a45b68f5b.jpg","artistName":"Guillaume Perret","eventURL":"https://www.eurosonic-noorderslag.nl/en/festival/line-up/act/guillaume-perret/"}]},{"id":"135416000461532","link":"/en/festival/line-up/act/brass-rave-unit/","description":"Brass Rave Unit","start":1484435700,"end":1484437500,"start_time":"00:15","end_time":"00:45","image":"https://www.eurosonic-noorderslag.nl/en/show-image/resource/11763/70c/70c/461532-429b7f74cc7c150c7e0b21a4f1223512-original.jpg/","day":"Saturday","location":"De Oosterpoort, Benedenzaal 1 - Kelder","text":"Brass Rave Unit delivers high octane muscle and lung powered raves at any location and at any time.
